						<h3>Association of CS Undergraduates - Corporate Chair </br> January 2020 - Present </h3>
						<h4>

							The Association of Computer Science Undergraduates (ACSU) is Cornell's chapter of the Association for
							Computing Machinery. Our primary purpose is to enhance the undergraduate experience in computer science.
							We do this by promoting professional, social, and educational interaction among students interested in
							computers or computer science, as well as facilitating students' communication with CS faculty, alumni,
							and corporate representatives. The corporate sub-team is responsible for hosting information sessions for
							companies of all sizes from the tech industry and beyond, which provide a great opportunity for members to
							learn about employment options and meet recruiters. <br><br>

							As the Corporate Chair, I am responsible for: <br><br>

							<ul>
								<li> Collaborating with Bowers CIS administrators to welcome recruiters on campus and ensure our events
									which attract more than 100 students meet the criteria for Cornellâ€™s on campus recruiting
								</li>

								<li> Leading a team of 8 corporate officers by developing and executing sponsorship goals each semester.
									In Spring 2022, my team has worked with more than 10 companies and raised over $4000 for ACSU
