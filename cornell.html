						<h3>Discrete Structures (CS2800) Teaching Assistant
							</br> January 2021 - Present
						</h3>
						<h4>
							<ul>
								<li>TA'ed under Professor Anke van Zuylen for the Spring 2021 semester;
									Professor Frans Schalekamp and Alexandra Silva for the Fall 2021 semester
								</li>
								<li>In my two semesters of being a TA, I have had the opportunity to run three
									recitation sections (both in-person and virtual), meeting over 75 students!
									I enjoy being able to guide my students through the discussion problems -
									the best feeling is when I'm able to see that the material connects!
								</li>
								<li>I am also responsible for grading 60 homework submissions each week and three
									exams throughout the semester. It's pretty neat to see students approach a
									problem in a different way than I thought of as well as see what Gradescope
									looks like from an instructor perspective.

						<h3>Big Red Ambassadors - Cornell Days Chair </br> September 2019 - Present</h3>
						<h4>
							<ul>
								<li>I assist Cornell's Undergraduate Admissions Office to see how our
									ambassador group of 80+ students can give prospective the loudest
									Big Red welcome. When Covid caused us to go virtual, I assisted them
									with identifying new virtual programs for over 1,800 admitted students
									as part of our annual Cornell Days.
								</li>

								<li>During the year, I manage Cornell's email inbox account. Although
									I try to check it as often as I can, I am so fortuante to have ten
									other ambassadors help me. I have developed training material as well as
									a new procedure to insure that students can receive a response quicker.
									If you have questions about life at Cornell please feel free to email
									us at cuambassadors@cornell.edu
								</li>

								<li>Back in December 2019, I was able to visit my high school in Long Island
									and present on student experience and residential life at Cornell. Additionally,
									I frequently attend information sessions hosted by Admissions to answer any
									questions that prospective students and their families may have.

						<h3>Association of CS Undergraduates - Corporate Chair </br> January 2020 - Present </h3>
						<h4>

							<ul>
								<li> I collaborate with recruiters from non-profits, start ups, and
									Fortune 500 companies to plan on campus information sessions for
									over 50 students in CIS searching for internships and full time opportunities.
									We are always looking for more companies to work with; if you
									are interested, please reach out to acsu@cornell.edu
								</li>

								<li> I oversee 10 ACSU officers to make sure that standards are being
									upheld and events are running smoothly. Additionally, I work with
									administration in the Engineering Careers and CIS department to ensure
									organizations have the best experience possible.
