					<h3><strong>Master of Science in Analytics Candidate </br>
							Computational Data Analytics Track</strong></h3>
				</header>

				<h4>
					<a href="https://www.analytics.gatech.edu">
						The Master of Science in Analytics is an interdisciplinary program that combines statistics, operations
						research, computing, and business by melding the world-class expertise of the College of Engineering’s
						Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering, the College of Computing’s School of Computational
						Science and Engineering, and the Scheller College of Business. By combining the strengths of these
						nationally ranked programs, graduates will be afforded the opportunity to integrate analytic skills in a
						unique and interdisciplinary way that yields deep insights into analytics problems. </br></br>

						Analytics is defined as “the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better
						decisions.” Tying together the new opportunities made possible by big data and computing, advanced
						quantitative methods from statistics and operations research, and the need for better business intelligence
						and decision support, analytics has quickly become a key facet of business strategy The MS Analytics
						program’s graduates will be able to move directly into business, industry, and government positions where
						they can apply the practical knowledge they have gained to immediately benefit their employers. </br></br>

						Students earning the MS Analytics degree will be able to understand and integrate fundamental principles and
						advanced concepts across the core analytics disciplines of computing, statistics, operations research, and
						business. Trained by world-class faculty in all of these areas, students will learn: identification and
						framing of problems;
						acquisition, management, and utilization of large and fast-moving streams of data;
						creation, analysis, solution, and interpretation of mathematical models using appropriate methodology; and
						the integration of these interdisciplinary skills to enable graduates to successfully develop and execute
						analytics projects.

							</br> - Wrote a policy brief to the Nassau County government
							which lobbied the use of housing vouchers to address housing
							inequality and increase the intergenerational mobility
							</br> - Used R's tidyverse package to aggregate five data frames
							in order to create visualizations through ggplot that emphasized
							locations in greatest need of support as well as the magnitude
							of the issue by comparing Nassau County against national data
							</br> - Fun Fact: This was the class that introduced me to R and
							made me passionate about data science and analytics, shout out
							to my TA Ari for the support he gave!
							</br></br>

							2. Blackjack

							</br> - Underwent full cycle development from creating a
							MVP to incorporating feature ideas suggested by test users
							and managed the project through a Trello Board
							</br> - Designed a Blackjack game engine that followed a REPL
							format that could be played in one's command line/terminal
							using OCaml where users could play against multiple levels of
							CPU and use functionalities such as "split" and "double"
							</br> - Wrote documentation that explained how the system was
							designed and incorporated justification for our choices in order
							to ensure our code was written as cleanly as possible

							code of ethics
							</br> - Investigated various companies mission statements and
							discussed how well their engineering development and operations
							related to it
							</br> - Argued the "un-objectiveness" of engineering and the
							consideration of tradeoffs from design choices as well as the
							need for leaders and employees to not lose sight over doing
							the greatest good even if is not a quick patch to the problem
							</br></br>

							4. Watercooler/The Layoff Project

							</br> - Assisted Policy, Analysis, and Management PhD Candidate

							values from over 50,000 rows of financial data and
							imputed them with estimates as well as mitigating the effects
							of outliers

							5. MLB Moneyball
							</br> - Identified and scraped data sources that were pertinent to
							the salary as well as aggregate them into a master data frame
							by using Python

							regression, and random walk optimization to answer research
							questions related to forming the best performing team given
							salary constraints
							</br> - Managed the Kanban board by creating stories and
							delegating to two other teammates as well as led retrospectives
							at each milestone to ensure successful project completion
							</br></br>

							6. Big Red Gym Rats
							</br> - Crafted questions about student fitness habits to
							conduct user research and led focus groups of ten students to
							validate design decisions and explore opportunities for new
							features
							</br> - Acted as the Product Manager for a team of five designers
							who created a medium fidelity prototype of a Cornell fitness
							app starting from ideation
							</br> - Participated in product roadmap planning, feature prioritization,
							and creating the slide deck for our final presentation pitch to
							a class of eighty undergraduates and master students
							</br></br>

							7. Neighborhood Insights from Crowds
							</br> - Used Google Trends to gain data about individual searches
							with the goal of finding how it relates to crime patterns
							</br> - Created Heat Map and Bubble Chart using Tableau to
							visualize findings and incorporated them in our final report on
							the “Wisdom of the Crowd” which emphasizes the predictive power of
							digital records from people’s daily activities
							</br> - Developed regression models to predict periods of heightened
							crime in various cities based on keywords in searches
