									<h3>Big Red Ambassadors</h3>
									<h4>
Within this organization, I am serving as the Cornell Days Chair. During a normal year, I would be planning the admitted students’ day which draws over 2000 students to campus. However, due to what is happening right now in the world, we have been shifting their experience to a virtual format. Though the events for a virtual Cornell Days haven’t been decided yet, I have been leading our Email Response Team which comprises of a group of 8 ambassadors. Working together, we respond to emails from prospective and admitted students asking about our academic programs as well as our campus life, such as where they can find the best food on campus (of course my answer is Terrace)!  </h4>

									<h3>Association of Computer Science Undergraduates</h3>
									<h4>ACSU is both a social and professional organization for all undergraduates interested in Computer Science. Joining this club has given me the chance to meet like-minded peers as well as develop a network of upper classmen who I can ask questions about classes and their experiences. Also, from the guest speakers, I learn about how to prepare for an interview and how to get involved with research. Lastly, I serve as a corporate officer so I work with recruiters to plan information sessions and tech talks for our members. These sessions are often my favorite as I often times get to hear from alumni about how they were able to apply their education at Cornell to the real world and create meaningful solutions.</h4>

									<h3>Ringle</h3>
									<h4>
I have been tutoring on this educational platform since March 2020 and have conducted over 75 lessons with over 25 different working professionals from all across the world. This position has honed me into a stronger communicator as it has made me more aware of my audience and how to present ideas in a more coherent manner. Additionally, interacting with students with various cultural backgrounds has given me the opportunity to expand my horizons and learn about different traditions. Because of my experience on Ringle, it has made me curious about language acquisition and the syntax of languages, leading me to take linguistic courses at Cornell. </h4>
