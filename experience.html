						<h2>Watercooler Project</h2>
						<h4>
							This is the current project I am working on with two PhD candidates
							in Policy Analysis and Management and Industrial Psychology. We are
							trying to learn more about involuntary layoff events - more specifically,
							our end goal is to create a predictive model using public data
							(though we're not sure if this is feasible just yet). </br></br>

							So far, I was able to investigate different sources that we could
							collect our data from. Once I conducted tests to determine the data's
							representativeness, I wrote queries to extract them. To prepare the data needed
							for analysis, I am currently working on writing a pipeline by using R to clean
							up the data.

						<h2>Trifecta of Social Justice, Engineering, and Communication</h2>
						<h4>
							This project was done as part of my Engineering Communications course.
							In my paper, I focused on the triangulation of the three factors and
							how they all interplay with each other. As part of this exploration,
							I wanted to analyze three different companies to see how they contribute
							to the normality of "objective" work in the engineering field. From this
							research, I learned about the importance in ethics and how there is a
							continued need to "do the right thing" as we innovate.

					<strong><u> Summer 2021 Internship</u> </strong> </br>
					This summer I worked under the Engineering and Data Science Team as a
					Program Management Intern. I was the Scrum Master for the Data Engineering
					Team, which consisted of 17 engineers. Here, I lead Scrum ceremonies
					such as daily stand ups and sprint retrospectives. Additionally, I
					worked with stakeholders to create and maintain a project schedule
					in order to track its health. I also wrote tutorials that detailed
					best Agile practices as well as technical documentations for using
					certain platforms. Lastly, I used my statistics knowledge to investigate
					the data collected from Jira during the team's sprints in order to
					determine how to make the team more efficient. </br></br>

					BrightInsight provided such a welcoming culture as I enjoyed doing
					virtual coffee chats with various team members here. This was an
					excellent learning experience for me and I'm very thankful to have
					had the opportunity to intern here. Special shoutout to the PMO Team
					since I worked with them on a daily basis and had many valuable
					takeaways!

						<h2>Blackjack - CS3110 Final Project</h2>
						<h4>
							For the final project in my functional programming course, my partner
							and I decided to create a game of Blackjack from scratch using OCaml.
							It was valuable to go through the full Software Development Lifecycle
							for the first time. We decided to use an Agile approach to our development
							as we came up with playable code each time. With each sprint, we were
							able to add more features by talking to our friends and learning about
							what would make the experience more exciting. Additionally, I got to
							practice designing tasks that had to be done through the use of a
							Trello board. Breaking functionalities down into individual tickets
							helped me understand what the code needed to do and how everything
							eventually fitted together.

						<h2>Housing Inequality - PAM2070 Policy Brief</h2>
						<h4>
							As part of the course "Big Data for Big Policy Problems," we had
							to write a mock policy brief to a local representative. I chose
							to focus mine on housing inequaity in Nassau County and applied
							concepts that we learned throughout the class. More importantly,
							I got a better glimpse of what it is like being a data scientist.
							This brief gave me the chance to create visuals through R's
							tidyverse package to help support my argument. I learned that this was
							something I enjoyed, so I can see myself doing more projects that
							emphasize this skill in the future!
