						<h2>MLB Project</h2>
						<h4>
							In my Data Science course, my team of three students had to analyze
							a dataset that we found interesting. We decided to focus on the MLB because of
							our interest in sports and sabermetrics after reading "Moneyball." Together,
							we were responsible for coming up with three separate questions that related
							to the salary of a professional pitcher. Because of my prior experience as
							a PM, I took on the responsibility of getting our team organized by
							maintaing a Kanban Board to keep track of our distribution of work and
							progress to ensure that all tasks were completed by the end of each
							milestone. Furthermore, I was able to identify sources containing
							data from the 2021 MLB season and combine all of them to create a
							"master" data frame in which we can perform our analysis on. This
							was an exciting project to work on because of the analysis techniques
							I've learned from in this class. My previous work would just require
							me to clean the data and create visualizations in which I drew
							conclusions from. But here, we have learned about machine learning
							techniques such as linear and logistical regression. So, I was able
							to fit a logistic regression model using statsmodels that had a
							82.65% accuracy rate on whether a given pitcher would make above
							or below the salary median. Additionally, I was able to implement
							a random walk optimization code that found a best performing team
							given a custom metric and constraint of salary. Doing this project
							made me realize why ML is such a trending field as there is so much
							predictive information that can be generated from past data. I think
							these analytics techniques are super intriguing and I am interested
							in learning more as well as taking more projects where I can apply
							these skills.

						<h2>Watercooler Project</h2>
						<h4>
							This was a project I helped a Cornell Policy Analysis Management
							PhD Candidate on during the Fall 2021 semester. The goal here was
							to understand more about how involuntary layoff events affected
							different parties. More specifically, how do the laid off workers
							express their sentiments online or what were some financial factors
							that these publicly traded companies were facing at the time. To help
							give some more context to this problem, I was responsible for the following
							technical tasks. First, I had to identify possible sources to extract
							data from. After doing some research and evaluating my options, I decided
							to choose Ravenpack because this was the most extensive and structured.
							So, I wrote code in Python that made API calls to their servers which
							extracted data from digital newspapers. The second part was after pulling
							the data and having previous scraped data, I needed to combine them
							to prepare them for analysis. Having learned how to use dplyr in my
							PAM course, I used that package to clean over 50,000 rows of data
							(more than any amount I have done so far)! Lastly, I used ggplot
							to do some exploratory plots in order to idenitfy possible trends
							and correlations and presented them to the principal investigator.

						<h2>Trifecta of Social Justice, Engineering, and Communication</h2>
						<h4>
							Being an engineer, I realize that we have great power in our hands.
							A civil engineer has design choices to make over infrastructure which
							millions of people depend on. A chemical engineer can develop medicine, but
							they need to run tests to ensure it is safe for human consumption. However,
							this made me think how software engineers and computer scientists are responsible
							for creating products that impact people. Personally, I believe that it is
							essential for individuals use their talents for good, which is why I decided
							to do a deep dive into the code of ethics for some companies to see how they
							are protecting their users as they scale. Additionally, I was curious to learn
							how their day to day operations would tie in to the mission statements that
							they had before the "tech boom." From this research project, I learned that
							engineering is anything but "objective." There is no such thing as the right way
							to do things as we are faced with tradeoffs every day. In fact many design patterns
							we see can be judgement calls influenced by previous experiences. We also have
							the responsiblity to think about how accessible our product is as software engineers
							should constantly be reminded about inclusivity rather than finding a quick patch
							to a problem. This made me realize that this indeed is a tough challenge to solve
							as the industry expands, but the integrity of "doing the right thing" is a
							trait that industry leaders can't lose site over.

				<h4>
					In summer of 2021, I worked as a Program Management Intern at a startup called
					BrightInsight. I wanted to explore a career path as a PM because from my previous
					experience at Cornell, I've enjoyed planning the roadmaps for projects. During this
					internship, I was able to lead the Data Engineering Team which consisted of 17 engineers
					as their Scrum Master by leading daily sprint standups to document project status, mitigate risk, and resolve
					dependencies all on a Jira Board! When not in meetings, I was also responsible for creating
					and maintaing project timelines for two microservices which required talking to various
					stakeholders in order to understand scope and specifications as well as delivering projects
					to our customers on time. Lastly, because of my engineering background, my manager gave
					a more analytical project as part of the PMO's key performance indicator to improve the
					time that our code can be shipped out. To do this, I had to write formulas within EazyBI
					and create visualizations using Jellyfish to present to senior management by showing how
					the team spends a long time on debugging during the sprint. Therefore, this can be attributed
					to poor code and design from the past which causes many dependencies or during the development
					process, the team isn't doing a strong enough job of getting tasks organized. It was quite interesting
					to me because this shows how businesses are increasingly relying on the use of data to drive decisions.
					From this internship, I was able to learn more about how Scrum and Agile processes are used
					in a real world setting. However, the most important thing I took away was that my interest
					is geared towards analytics and being able to clean up data to create visualizations and
					tell stories to relevant stakeholders to help improve processes.

						<h2>Blackjack - CS3110 Final Project</h2>
						<h4>
							My partner and I developed a game of Blackjack from scratch in OCaml
							for the final project in our functional programming course. We chose
							to make this game because we wanted to create something that helped
							us pass time during the pandemic. This project was a valuable experience,
							not only because did it help me learn OCaml better, but it allowed me
							to work through the full Software Development Lifecycle. We used a Trello
							Board to help us keep track of tasks that had to be done, which helped
							us immensely during the planning stage since it enabled us to develop
							the game iteratively by thinking about the core functionalities. After
							implementing and testing it, we had to structure our code to ensure that
							it can be incorporated into later parts seamlessly. Upon completition
							of our game, we were able to create a Blackjack engine that could be
							played in one's terminal using a REPL format. Furthermore, our game
							enabled multiple levels of a CPU multi-player as well as the ability
							to bet. When we were making this game, this was the longest program
							I have written and I had some takeaways from this experience. First,
							to ensure that we are making programs of value, it is important to
							talk to stakeholders so we can get their feedback and improve our code.
							Second, writing logical/readable code and having comments when working with
							a team will greatly speed up the debugging process by helping others understand.
							Lastly, don't underestimate the planning stage as doing a good job will simplify
							control flow leading to more straight forward code which is what we should strive for.

						<h2>Housing Inequality - PAM2070 Policy Brief</h2>
						<h4>
							I took this course because I was curious about what a career would
							be like as a data scientist. Not having heard much of Policy Analysis Management
							before, I was intrigued to see how this field would overlap with a more technical
							discipline. Here, I was first introduced to R and the tidyverse package.
							For our final project, we had to write a policy brief to address a policy
							problem that was discussed in the course. I chose to write about housing
							inequality in Nassau County where I am from. To lobby the use of housing vouchers
							to increase the intergenerational mobility for children, I cleaned five datasets
							totaling over 6000 rows and used ggplot to create visualizations. These visualizations
							helped to contextualize the problem by indicating where Nassau County stood on a variety
							of factors and which locations within this county needed the most support in order to
							deter their children from unlawful activities.
