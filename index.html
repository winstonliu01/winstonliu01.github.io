						<h2>Hi, I'm Winston!</h2>
						<h4>
							Originally from Long Island, New York, I am a current undergraduate at Cornell University where I study
							computer science (CS) and operations research (ORIE). I fell in love with both CS and ORIE because I think
							of the problems that these fields aim to solve as one big puzzle. For instance, when I program, I think
							about each line as a puzzle piece that when assembled properly gives you a satisfying picture. Overall, I
							believe that both of these areas of study have a great potential to innovate technology to revolutionize
							the world into a better place. </br></br>

							Thank you for stopping by my website, where you will be able to learn more about what I am currently
							doing. Before you click around, I would like to list some fun facts about myself so you get to know me
							better ðŸ˜ƒ </br></br>

							1. I am a huge outdoors person. During the school year, you can catch me playing tennis or basketball as
							well as rock climbing. In the winter time, I enjoy snowboarding and try to skate board the rest of the
							time to keep my skills fresh! </br></br>
							2. I played violin throughout my childhood and was a member of my high schoolâ€™s chamber orchestra.
							Although I donâ€™t have perfect pitch, playing the violin has deepened my appreciation for music. I love to
							discover new music and listen to many different genres, but Ed Sheeran by far is my favorite artist.
							</br></br>
							3. I enjoy visiting Taiwan a lot! My grandparent and other family members live there, so I love being able
							to catch up with them. But, the night markets are a must go as there are so many delicious food that I
							crave often while in the States.
