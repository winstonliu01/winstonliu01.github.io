						<h2>Hi, thanks for stopping by!</h2>
						<h4>

							My name is Winston and I am a senior at Cornell's College of Engineering
							where I major in Computer Science and minor in Operations Research/Management Science.
							By studying these two areas, I have become interested in designing
							and applying algorithms to solve technical challenges as well as using data
							(whether it is producing visualizations or creating predictive models) to
							analyze problems faced by businesses. Aside from working on a variety of projects
							at Cornell, my professional experiences include interning at Salesforce as a Site Reliability Engineer
							and BrightInsight, a digital health startup, as a Program Manager.<br><br>

							But, here are some fun facts about myself that is not on my resume :) <br><br>

							1. I love to move around and be active! This includes playing tennis, basketball, or football (non-tackle
							of course) with my friends. At Cornell, I have also picked up rock climbing so you might catch
							me bouldering at Lindseth Climbing Center sometimes. In the winter time, I enjoy
							spending time on the mountains where I go snowboarding and indulging sweets from
							the Waffle Cabin. Catch me riding a balance board in the office if there's one available! <br><br>

							2. I don't quite consider myself to be a foodie since I don't believe in the
							"camera eats first," however a lot of my friends do ask me for recommendations.
							Nonetheless, I do enjoy trying out new cuisines and am pretty lucky that The
							Establishment restaurant exists on our campus because some of my fellow Cornellians
							know how to cook and make their own menu. My go to drink is passion fruit green tea
							with boba and I am a huge fan of scallion pancakes, soup dumplings, and sushi!<br><br>

							3. My parents are originally from Taiwan and it has been one of my favorite places to
							visit. Obviously having family there makes it great, but there is so much to do from
							exploring the modern city of Taipei to the natural scenery in the South. I enjoy
							going to Tamsui the most because of the beautiful river and the plethora of food
							options from the night market (ok maybe I am a foodie). If you want any recommendations
							on things to do in Taiwan, feel free to reach out as I am more than happy to share must visit
							places to get the best food. <br><br>

							4. Aside from playing sports, I do enjoy watching
							basketball, hockey, and tennis. I am a huge supporter of the New York Knicks and Mets
							where I hope each season for a championship. My favorite tennis player is Roger Federer
							and I was able to see him play live in Arthur Ashe a few years ago. But, the team you
							can constantly see me cheer in person for is the Cornell Men's Hockey Team - go Big Red!
							I always love the energy in Lynah Rink and the traditions behind the student section. <br><br>
