						<h2>Hi, thanks for stopping by!</h2>
						<h4>
							I'm Winston and I currently spend my time between Long Island and
							Ithaca, New York. I attend Cornell University where I study
							Computer Science and Operations Research (minor) in the College of
							Engineering, with an expected graduation date of May 2023. These two
							fields have helped hone my problem solving and analytical skills.
							My interest lie in designing better algorithms and
							making sense out of messy data with an emphasis on leveraging the
							power of technology for positive societal impact. </br></br>

							Although I don't know what I want to do for the future, I am interested
							in learning more about the fields of software engineering, product management, and
							quantitative research. In the summer of 2021, I worked at a Digital Health
							startup called BrightInsight as a Program Management intern. This experience
							gave me a better understanding of how businesses operate in an Agile environment
							as well as what a PM does on a day to day basis. This summer (2022),
							I will be interning at Salesforce in Burlington, MA as a Site Reliability Engineer. </br></br>

							Aside from work, here are some fun fact about myself!</br></br>

							1. I am someone who enjoys living an active lifestyle; in fact, you
							can probably find me playing different sports during my free time.
							When the weather is nice, I love to play tennis, basketball, and golf
							outdoors with my friends and family. I'm a pretty big Knicks fan so
							always happy to chat about my team's struggle or about the NBA in
							general. During the winter season, I like to go to Lindseth to boulder
							or go snowboarding in the Northeast. If you know of any must-visit
							mountains, recommendations are always appreciated! </br></br>

							2. I enjoy staying up to date on the latest financial trends by either
							watching business news or reading articles online. Knowing what is impacting the
							market, helps me become a better trader. Being able to synthesize various
							information and analyze data to determine whether to invest in a company or
							not is a fun way I like to apply my academic background. Additionally, it's
							great knowing that the products engineers develop have an impact on a
							company's valuation and how they are viewed publicly. </br></br>

							3. My parents are from Taiwan and I still have extended family living
							there. The background photo on this website was actually taken from my
							grandparents' home in the New Taipei district. When I visit, I love
							to spend time with my family there by playing Mahjong and trying out
							local cuisines. This includes ordering way too much soup dumplings
							(Xiaolongbao) and bubble tea at the night markets. </br></br>
