						<h2>Hi, I'm Winston!</h2>
						<h4>
							Thanks for stopping by and learning more about me! </br></br>

							I am originally from Long Island though I have begun to call
							Ithaca, NY home as well. Right now, I'm a junior in the
							College of Engineering at Cornell University studying
							Computer Science and Operations Research. These two fields interested
							me because they have the potential to help innovate technology faster
							in order to make the world into a better place. </br></br>

							Although I don't know what I want to do for the future, I am interested
							in learning more about software engineering, product management, and
							quantitative research (particularly in the financial and healthcare industry).
							I hope to do so by interning during Summer 2022, so I can get a better
							understanding of the challenges and opportunities that exist in these industry. </br></br>

							Before you click around on my website, I would love to share some
							facts about myself so we can know each other better!</br></br>

							1. Last summer (2021), I interned at a MedTech startup as a PM. It
							was a great experience as it gave me exposure to Agile and the
							healthcare industry. My internship here has made me more curious
							about the potential technology has in improving patient outcomes
							as it seems as if this industry is technologically lagging compared
							to others. For example, in the FinTech world, there have been leaders
							that have emerged as the de facto platform. I think it will be
							interesting to see who in healthcare can innovate the fastest to
							provide patients and providers with a tool that is secure and
							easy to access/manage. </br></br>
							2. I enjoy living an active lifestyle and enjoy playing various
							types of sports. When the weather is nice, tennis and basketball
							are the ones I typically play the most, though I do play golf
							occasionally. During the winter, I love going snowboarding as the
							crisp mountain air really energizes me. And at Cornell, I learned
							how to rock climb and am belay certified - rock climbing is the
							one sport where I'll say it is harder than it looks! </br></br>
							3. My parents moved to America from Taiwan and I still have family
							there. The background photo on my website is actually from my
							grandparents' home in the New Taipei district. Aside from spending
							time with them (particularly playing Mahjong), I also love
							Taiwanese cuisine. There are so many interesting foods at the
							night market and I probably spend an unhealthy amount of time there
							when I visit. Xiaolongbao or soup dumplings are my favorite and
							Din Tai Fung does a great job of making them, so I'm super jealous
							in the US, they are only available on the West Coast. </br></br>
