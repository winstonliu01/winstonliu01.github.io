						<h2>Hi, thanks for stopping by!</h2>
						<h4>
							My name is Winston and I am currently a Site Reliability Engineer
							for Salesforce's Government Cloud. I am also a Master's Student at
							Georgia Institute of Technology where I study Analytics. Prior to
							this, I did my undergraduate at Cornell University in
							Ithaca, New York and received my degree in Computer Science with
							a minor in Operations Research from the College of Engineering.
							<br><br>

							Here are some of my hobbies when I am not working or studying:
							<br><br>

							1. Growing up, I was a big tennis player. Though I still play for
							fun, I have added pickleball to the mix. You can also catch me
							playing pickup basketball and some two hand touch football. Aside
							from sports, I do enjoy spending time outdoors. Ever since my trip
							to Norway and Sweden, I have started to go on more hikes and
							kayaking. Staying active and reconnecting with nature is one of
							my ways to wind down! <br><br>

							2. I'm not quite a big foodie, but I can always appreciate
							trying out new cuisines and restaurants. I love Taiwanese food,
							especially soup dumplings and beef wrapped in a scallion pancake.
							While at Cornell, I took HADM 4300 (Introduction to Wines) and
							nowadays, I try to apply my classroom knowledge at the wine store.
							Yes, we do more than just drink in that class! My favorite wines
							include Riesling from the Finger Lakes and Cabernet Sauvignon
							from Napa Valley. I have really enjoyed trying to find wines to
							pair with my meals. <br><br>

							3. My parents immigrated from Taiwan and I still have family
							who lives there. So, Taiwan especially New Taipei is somewhere
							that I frequently travel to. Some of my favorite memories there
							include exploring food stalls and playing arcade games at the
							night markets. Additionally, there is a lot of beauty in Southern
							Taiwan and plenty of opportunities to walk around national parks
							and drink local tea. It is truly an underrated country and I
							highly recommend adding it to your travel list - there is something
							for everyone! <br><br>

							4. When I am feeling like a couch potato, you can catch me
							watching sports. Being raised in NY, I am quite passionate about
							the local teams even though they have resulted in a lot of
							heartbreaks. My favorite teams are the New York Knicks and
							New York Mets - I hope for better days for them. Prior to his
							retirement, Roger Federer was my favorite player, but I still
							actively follow the tennis grand slams. <br><br>
