									<h2>Cornell Hyperloop</h2>
									<h4>
Cornell Hyperloop is an engineering project team that gives the opportunity to students to solve complex problems in a team-based setting. Hyperloop is a proposed mode of transportation that made headlines recently because of the efforts of Elon Musk. It is described as a system where a pod can travel in a sealed pod that is substantially free of air-resistance. This innovative technology would be a quicker and more energy efficient way of travelling than what is currently available.</h4>

<strong><u> Fall 2020</u> </strong> </br>
	This was my first semester working on Hyperloop as a hardware sub team member and I worked on the sensor project. I researched various sensors such as pressure, vibration, 
	and long-range finders to see which ones would fit our needs the best. The purpose of these sensors are to collect data and pass it along to other sub teams, especially to 		alert them when our algorithm detects something wrong going with our pod. At the end of the semester, I combined my weekly deliverables into one main code. The code collected 		and processed data from multiple sensors and sent it to another Arduino via a Transmitter Receiver module.
